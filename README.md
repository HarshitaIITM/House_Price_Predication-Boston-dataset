# Boston House Price Prediction using Machine Learning


Description:

Welcome to the Boston House Price Prediction project repository! In this project, the power of machine learning is leveraged to predict house prices in the Boston area. Accurate prediction of house prices is crucial for various stakeholders, including real estate agents, homeowners, and potential buyers, to make informed decisions.

Key Features:

Dataset Exploration: Detailed exploration and analysis of the Boston Housing dataset are provided, including data visualization to gain insights into various features affecting house prices.

Preprocessing: The preprocessing pipeline encompasses data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values to ensure the quality of input data for machine learning models.

Model Development: Various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are employed to build predictive models for house price estimation.

Model Evaluation: Performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search are utilized to enhance model performance and find the optimal set of parameters.

Deployment: Instructions and scripts are provided for deploying the trained model, enabling users to make real-time predictions on new data or integrate the model into their applications.

Documentation: Detailed documentation is available throughout the project, including explanations of methodologies, code comments, and usage guidelines, facilitating easy understanding and replication.
