Title: Boston House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Description:

Welcome to our Boston House Price Prediction project repository! In this project, we leverage the power of machine learning to predict house prices in the Boston area. Predicting house prices accurately is crucial for various stakeholders, including real estate agents, homeowners, and potential buyers, to make informed decisions.

Key Features:

Dataset Exploration: We provide detailed exploration and analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, including data visualization to gain insights into various features affecting house prices.

Preprocessing: Our preprocessing pipeline includes data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling missing values to ensure the quality of input data for our machine learning models.

Model Development: We employ various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to build predictive models for house price estimation.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: To enhance model performance, we perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search to find the optimal set of parameters for our models.

Deployment: We provide instructions and scripts for deploying the trained model, allowing users to make real-time predictions on new data or integrate the model into their applications.

Documentation: Detailed documentation is provided throughout the project, including explanations of methodologies, code comments, and usage guidelines to facilitate easy understanding and replication.
