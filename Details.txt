## Dragon Real Estate project ##
1. Problem teardown:
a)we are given a dataset of house prices with some features like the number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, etc.
b) Our task is to create a model that will predict the price of any new house by looking at the features.

2.Geeting started(Important question to ask):
a)What is the business object and end goal? How will Dragon Real Estate benefit from the model?
ans: The Dragon Real Estate wants to use this model to predict house prices in a given area and will invest in the area if it is undervalued.
b)How does the current solution look like?
ans: Manual experts who analyze the features(The prediction has an error rate of 25% which is why Dragon Real estates Pvt Ltd. wants to use the ML model).

3. Finding the type of model to build:
a)Supervised
b)Regression task
c)Batch learning

4. Selecting a performance measure:
a)Root mean square error(RMSE)-prefered for regression task
b)Other performance measures: Mean absolute error, Manhattan norm, etc

5. Checking the assumptions:
a)Make sure that the team needs the price and not the categories like expensive, cheap, etc.

6.Info about data:
I am taking data very short.
stratified sampling to divide data equally according to one character(from the data or one column from data)

7.Techonology used:
a)Sikit learn
b)Numpy
c)Pandas
d)joblib
